Student Path: 

Tuesday 9th Afternoon:
GENERAL IDEA: Social media app for Hult students to chat before they come to Hult with other incoming freshman.

CHANGE OF IDEA: Platform on WeChat (include Chinese people), a platform that combindes infomation on interests to pair with possible 'friends'. A profile consists of links to students other social medias, a Bio of the Hult experience if current student. As a way to help freshman interact with students to help them feel less alone before coming.

-Built a survey based on what we want to know from hult students, such as: would they download WeChat, would they want an app, do they think it is beneficial to have before coming to hult
--Survey was posotive, made us lock in our idea. 

-Carried out further research and statistics on current problem to find the need.
